## personal projects
If you’re just starting out and don’t have much “real” experience to add, this is a great way to focus your energy.

Here’s a few ideas of things you can build:

A blog
An HTML5 game
An online quiz
A website for a friend or family member
Informative site — make it educational, like Maxwell Ogden’s JavaScript for Cats, or make it funny like Jessica Hishe’s momthisishowtwitterworks.com

## Documented source code
Again, it’s all about context on your portfolio site…and off it.

If you’re including links to your repositories on Github, make sure you provide context/documentation so people don’t have to struggle to understand what is going on with the project.

You can do this in the readme.md. Explain what the project is as well as how to use it.

This isn’t only helpful to employers, but also for anyone wanting to use whatever it is you created!
